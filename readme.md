#Color Hunt Microservice API

Some data I gathered from https://colorhunt.co using inspect element, returned from micro https://github.com/zeit/micro

##Getting Started
I built this api by following this example on the zeit website https://zeit.co/docs/examples/json-api 

I am returning an array from index.js within the module.exports() function.
(https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html)

##Prerequisites
Node.js, npm, and micro https://github.com/zeit/micro

##Give examples
https://json-api-lohuhjmqta.now.sh/ to query my deployment.

...Or

[If you want to make your own..!] (https://zeit.co/now#get-started).

##Installing

Clone this repository, and open the directory you cloned it to in a terminal.

Run 
```
npm install
now
```
to start your own deployment locally.

It will either prompt you on the command line or in the browser to enter your email. Do so and you will be sent a verificaition email. Click on the link and it will start your deployment. If you have issues with this, try following the instructions on https://zeit.co/now#get-started to host your own deployment.
